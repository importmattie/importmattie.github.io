          <h1>Bio</h1><hr>
          <h4>My First Computer</h4>
          <p class="padded-paragraph">
            My love of technology was fostered by a mid '90s AT&T computer with a 60 MHz processor, Windows 3.1, and a bunch of fun games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Baron_(1990_video_game)">Red Baron</a> and Typing Tutor.
            One of my favorite tech memories is when my dad told me our computer was getting a second hard drive with <strong>A WHOLE GIGABYTE OF STORAGE!</strong>
            Another is how thrilled I was to borrow and watch a promotional video for Windows 95.
            One of my least favorite memories is when I asked what games an old IBM computer I inhereted could run.
            They laughed and said I should just use it as an anchor.
            Maybe that was why my parents bought the AT&T.
          </p>
          <h4>Early Gaming</h4>
          <p class="padded-paragraph">
            Speaking of video games, it's probably no surprise that I loved them from an early age.
            I was a huge SEGA Genesis / Sonic the Hedgehog fan.
            I used to beg my neighbor to let me play his Genesis until I found one under the Christmas tree.
            In fact, I taught myself what hexadecimal numbers were using the sound test screen in Sonic the Hedgehog 2.
            I can't see myself having such an interest in technology without either the SEGA Genesis or AT&T Computer entering my life.
          </p>
          <h4>Discovering Programming</h4>
          <p class="padded-paragraph">
            In high school, I didn't take any programming classes primarily because, get this, they wouldn't inflate my GPA compared to other options.
            Instead, I focused on math and science and decided Meteorology was a good marriage of those fields.
            Luckily, I recovered from that misstep by taking a Computer Science 101 course in the spring of my freshman year at the University of Miami.
            From there, I started plotting how to fit a Computer Science major into my degree.
          </p>
          <h4>Detour In Other Worlds</h4>
          <p class="padded-paragraph">
            I should have been smart enough then to recognize where my heart was, but instead I pursued a PhD in Atmospheric Science at Rutgers University.
            I was drawn in by climate modeling.
            How cool is it that by writing code you can get statistics on current and future climate?
            In particular, I have fond memories of creating "idealized worlds" - essentially drawing my own continents - in a simple climate model and watching what happened.
          </p>
          <h4>Finding Myself</h4>
          <p class="padded-paragraph">
            I finished my degree and spent a year as a postdoctoral researcher cobbling together some scientific software to help with data analysis.
            In the process, I realized I loved building the software but just didn't have much of a passion for doing scientific data analysis anymore.
            I also surprised myself and married another PhD student, which made the prospect of constantly moving between the somewhat limited locations of employment in my field as often as each year even more unappealing.
            These factors led me to finally "flip the switch" and become a (web) developer, and I often wonder why I didn't do that sooner.
            (I <strong>did</strong> meet my wife and her cat because of graduate school, so that alone made it worth it!)
          </p>
          <h4>Takeaway</h4>
          <p class="padded-paragraph">
            Don't be afraid to pursue what you love, and it's never too late to switch.

        <!-- FAQ -->
        <div id="content-faq" class="col-md-9 content" style="display: none;">
          <h1>FAQ</h1><hr>
          <p class="faq-question">1) Wait, you have a PhD? Why are you doing web development?</p>
          <p class>
            Yes, <a href="https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/47489/">I have a PhD</a>,
            but I get more enjoyment and fulfillment out of building websites.
            I may write an article about my experience at some point in the future.
          </p>
          <p class="faq-question">2) But don't you want to be a professor?</p>
          <p>
            Maybe at some point I did.
            But a lot of people I've talked to are unaware that a PhD doesn't guarantee you a job as a professor.
            It turns out they don't hand them out along with your diploma.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think about it.
            Each professor generally graduates, say, 10 new PhDs throughout his career.
            Even if the number of academic positions doubled or so with each generation, that's still 80% of graduates who have no job as a professor.
            The rest have to do <strong>something</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll take work in a field that I enjoy more, generally pays a better salary, and allows me to settle down sooner in a heartbeat.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/upshot/so-many-research-scientists-so-few-openings-as-professors.html?_r=0">This article</a> from the (failing) New York Times explains the situation fairly well. I also like <a href="https://medium.economist.com/why-doing-a-phd-is-often-a-waste-of-time-349206f9addb">this one</a> from The Economist.
          </p>
          <p class="faq-question">3) Bitter much about #1 and #2?</p>
          <p>
            No, I just have strong feelings about academia and the stigma around leaving it.
            I know people who are too afraid to leave and pursue a new career primarily because they don't want to disappoint advisors, family, etc.
            That's not healthy for anyone.
